# hello-world
This repository is for me to practice with GitHub's flow.

This is a *brief* introduction.

I am a Senior Product Manager who's trying to find his way.
I do not have a technical background.
But I add value in other ways.
I'm learning new things every day.
Trying to apply those learnings to create value.

And here I am, learning GitHub.
